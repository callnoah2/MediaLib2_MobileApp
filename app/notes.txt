Added MediaLibApplication to the project. Prof already had it there, perhaps I should have had it already
Is it for the entire project or just the one of the views?
in his VeiwModel, notesRepository was lowercase, but his actual repository was uppercase.
in my viewmodel, the BoardGamesRepository us uppercase and it was like that already for the init that was already being used
Errors for getting/using IDs, so... fix that I guess.
